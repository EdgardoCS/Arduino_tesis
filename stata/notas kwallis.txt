kruskal-wallis H test
asumptions:	
	1. Your two variables should be measured on an ordinal scale or a continuous scale
	2. Your independent variable should consist of two or more categorical, independent (unrelated) groups
	3. You should have independence of observations
	4. you have to determine whether the distributions in each group have the same shape. However, if your distributions have a different shape, you can only use the Kruskal-Wallis H test to compare mean ranks.

Compare effects of different stimulation speed, same site. 
set-up
group . 15 participants /each site
find if exists statistically differences between groups
a) speed1
b) speed2
c) speed3
d) speed4
e) speed5
f) speed6
dependent variable: VAS score (pleasantness)

result.

Upper back
chi-squared with ties =     6.295 with 5 d.f.
probability =     0.2786
Forearm
chi-squared with ties =     7.350 with 5 d.f.
probability =     0.1959

group . 15 participants
find if existe statically differences between sites, same speed

a) speed1 vs speed1
chi-squared with ties =     0.000 with 1 d.f.
probability =     0.9835
b) speed2 vs speed2
chi-squared with ties =     0.414 with 1 d.f.
probability =     0.5201
c) speed3 vs speed3
chi-squared with ties =     0.021 with 1 d.f.
probability =     0.8842
d) speed4 vs speed4
chi-squared with ties =     0.415 with 1 d.f.
probability =     0.5195
e) speed5 vs speed5
chi-squared with ties =     0.007 with 1 d.f.
probability =     0.9338
f) speed6 vs speed6
chi-squared with ties =     0.363 with 1 d.f.
probability =     0.5469
